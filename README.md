# üèòÔ∏è Real Estate Price Prediction Model

## Project Overview

This project focuses on building a **Real Estate Price Prediction Model** using machine learning techniques. The model estimates housing prices based on various input features such as location, area, and number of rooms. It uses a structured dataset and provides both a visual and an interactive interface for predictions.

### **Goal**:
- Develop a regression model to predict house prices accurately.
- Achieve reliable performance and interpretability through visualization and evaluation metrics.

### **Machine Learning Task**:
- **Task Type**: Regression  
- **Target Variable**: `House_Price` (continuous numerical value)  
- **Success Criteria**: Low RMSE, good R¬≤ score, and interpretable results.
